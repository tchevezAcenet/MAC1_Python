Variables in Python are also case sensitive. For example, age, Age and AGE are three different variables. The name we choose for variables should be meaningful so you or another programmer know what it is.\n",

    "As a final note, we will explore an alternative way to print a string or contents of a variable on the output screen in Python, and it is called formatted string literals or f-strings for short. This feature was added to Python in version 3.6. The real benefit of using f-strings instead of print() is shown when you need to format strings using multiple values. Rather than doing multiple string concatenation, you can directly use the name of a variable or include an expression in the string. Being able to embed entire expressions inside of a string literal is a useful feature, and can also make for more clear and concise code. This will become very clear when you begin to write more code and the use cases for your code becomes non-trivial.\n",
