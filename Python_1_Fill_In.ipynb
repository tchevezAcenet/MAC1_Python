    "In the previous example of coding in Python, we saw that we can use Python as an advanced calculator. However, the results of these computations are lost after we perform our operations. If we want to save and reuse any value in a code, we need to save these computations in a place in computer memory to be able to access it in the future. \n",

    "Variables are names that we associate with a memory location in computers. As such variables are not values themselves but they point to a memory location where the actual values are stored. Variables in Python can only contain letters, digits, and underscore _ (typically used to separate words in long variable names) and they cannot start with a digit. Variables in Python are also case sensitive. For example, age, Age and AGE are three different variables. The name we choose for variables should be meaningful so you or another programmer know what it is.\n",

    "As a final note, we will explore an alternative way to print a string or contents of a variable on the output screen in Python, and it is called formatted string literals or f-strings for short. This feature was added to Python in version 3.6. The real benefit of using f-strings instead of print() is shown when you need to format strings using multiple values. Rather than doing multiple string concatenation, you can directly use the name of a variable or include an expression in the string. Being able to embed entire expressions inside of a string literal is a useful feature, and can also make for more clear and concise code. This will become very clear when you begin to write more code and the use cases for your code becomes non-trivial.\n",
