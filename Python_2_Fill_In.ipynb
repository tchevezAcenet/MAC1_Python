    "## Functions in Python\n",
    "A function is a block of code that performs a specific task and will only run when it is called. Suppose you need to create a program to create a blank box and then fill the box with some characters. You can create three functions to solve this problem: a function that creates a blank box, a function that reads the characters from users, and a function that fills the box with user characters. Therefore, we can divide a complex problem into smaller sections which makes our program easy to understand and reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have three different types of functions in Python: **built-in functions, external-library functions, and user-defined functions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Three main types of functions in Python are built-in functions which exist in the base version of Python, external-library functions which come with the external libraries, and they are defined inside the library, and finally user-defined functions which can be defined by you.\n",
    "\n",
    "We already used a few built-in functions in Python. For example, **print()** is a built-in function that will print the specified message on the screen, or other standard output device.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a function, we need to call it first. Any function that is called in Python should have parentheses after its name. An argument is a value inside the parentheses which will be passed into a function. print() for example can take zero or more arguments. print() with no arguments (zero arguments) prints a blank line."

    "## Type conversions\n",
    "The process of converting a Python data type into another data type is known as type conversion. There are mainly two types of type conversion methods in Python: implicit type conversion and explicit type conversion. In Python, when the data type conversion takes place during interpretation or during the runtime, it’s called an implicit data type conversion. Python handles the implicit data type conversion, so we don’t have to explicitly convert the data type into another data type. See the below example for an implicit data type conversion:"

    "Further, we have declared another variable named ‘sum’ and stored the result of the addition in it. When we checked the data type of the sum variable, we could see that the data type of the sum variable had been automatically converted into the float data type by the Python interpreter. This is called implicit type conversion. The reason that the sum variable was converted into the float data type and not the integer data type is that if the compiler had converted it into the integer data type, then it would’ve had to remove the fractional part, which would have resulted in data loss. So, Python always converts smaller data types into larger data types to prevent the loss of data.\n",

For explicit type conversion, there are some built-in Python functions but here, we will focus on the main three built-in functions for data conversion:\n",
